# CI/CD Pipeline for AWS ECS Deployment

This project demonstrates a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for building, pushing and deploying Docker containers to Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) using GitHub Actions. The pipeline integrates **Docker**, **AWS** and **GitHub Actions** to streamline the deployment process, allowing for rapid and secure updates to the application with minimal manual intervention.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the entire process of building, testing and deploying a Dockerized application to AWS ECS using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is configured to trigger automatically upon code changes, allowing for continuous integration and deployment. Key steps include:

1. **Code Checkout**: The latest code is fetched from GitHub.
2. **Docker Image Build**: A Docker image is built and tagged.
3. **Push to Docker Hub**: The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub.
4. **AWS Deployment**: The ECS service is updated with the new image to ensure the latest version is running in production.

## Key Features

- **Continuous Integration**: Automates the build and test processes with every push to the repository.
- **Dockerized Application**: The application is containerized using Docker, making it portable and consistent across environments.
- **Automated Deployment**: The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub and the ECS service is updated automatically using AWS CLI commands.
- **Version Control**: GitHub Actions ensures that only the latest code is deployed, providing versioning and rollback capabilities.
- **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: The ECS deployment and updates are handled through AWS, making it scalable and resilient.

## Technologies Used

- **GitHub Actions**: A powerful tool for automating workflows directly from your GitHub repository.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application, making it easier to deploy and manage.
- **AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: A service for managing Docker containers at scale on AWS infrastructure.
- **AWS CLI**: A command-line tool for managing AWS resources, used here for automating ECS deployments.
- **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based repository for storing Docker images.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Set Up AWS CLI with IAM Credentials
Make sure you have configured your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI. You can configure your AWS credentials by running:

```bash
aws configure
```

Provide your Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, AWS Region and Output format when prompted.

 ### 3. Set Up Docker Hub

- Create a Docker Hub account if you don’t already have one: https://hub.docker.com/
- Log in to Docker Hub from the command line:
```bash

docker login
```
- Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub:
```bash
docker build -t your-docker-hub-username/my-app .
docker push your-docker-hub-username/my-app
```
### 4. Set Up GitHub Actions
The GitHub Actions workflow configuration is located in the .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml file. Ensure the following environment variables are set in the GitHub Secrets for secure access:

- DOCKER_USERNAME
- DOCKER_PASSWORD
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY


These secrets will be used in the GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate with Docker Hub and AWS.

### 5. AWS ECS Deployment
Ensure that the AWS ECS Cluster and Service are set up. You can create a new ECS cluster and service from the AWS Management Console or use the AWS CLI.

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the latest Docker image to your ECS service.

### 6. Trigger the CI/CD Pipeline
Push any changes to your GitHub repository and the pipeline will automatically trigger, performing the following:

- Building the Docker image
- Pushing it to Docker Hub
- Deploying it to AWS ECS

Future Improvements
- Security Scanning: Add Docker security scanning to ensure that all images are free from vulnerabilities.
- Staging Environment: Integrate a staging environment for pre-production testing before deploying to production.
- Infrastructure as Code: Use Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to define and provision the entire AWS infrastructure (ECS cluster, VPC, security groups).
- Notifications: Add notifications for build status (via Slack, email, etc.) using GitHub Actions.
- Auto-scaling: Implement auto-scaling for ECS services based on resource usage to handle increased traffic.
